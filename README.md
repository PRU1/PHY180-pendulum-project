Pendulum project for PHY180

All data is stored in `pendulum_data.xlsx`. Each trial was repeated three times for different release angles between -80 to 80 degrees, in increments of 10. An additional trial was recorded for -80 to 80 degrees, in increments of 20 degrees. Relevant data was saved into the text files in this repository, and used in Prof. Brian Wilson's provided python code to generate best fit parameters and propagate uncertainties. 

The report was written using LaTeX. 
Report errata: At one point units of (1/s) are written for Q factor; this is a mistake since the Q factor is dimensionless
